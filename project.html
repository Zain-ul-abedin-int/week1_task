    <h3>Quill Clone</h3>
   
      
<p>
  I'm currently working on a personal project â€” a clone of the popular writing app <strong>Quill</strong>. 
So far, I've completed the <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> structure, designing a clean and minimal interface that focuses on user-friendly writing. 
The next stage will be building the <strong>functional editor</strong> using JavaScript to support rich text formatting and more. 
This project is helping me strengthen my front-end skills and build confidence in crafting interactive user experiences.
